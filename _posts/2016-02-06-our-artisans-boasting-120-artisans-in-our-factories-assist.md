OUR ARTISANS Boasting 120 artisans in our factories, assisted by another 85 further artisans, PERORNO is, by far, the largest handcrafted jewellery manufacturing company in Spain. Our base in Cordoba is extremely fitting for PERORNO because Cordoba is specially renowned for its strong position in the jewellery industry. A perfect location for access to a pool of talented Artisans. The Cordoba Artisan community is thoroughly involved and takes great pride in developing the finest Artisans in the world. Our Artisans defy expectations by paying great attention to detail and creating luxurious high end quality designs. Every Artisan we have employed so far is local, helping to encourage local work and sustainability. Large corporations come here purely to use their skills, which have been acquired over centuries of hard work.
